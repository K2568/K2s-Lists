# K2's Lists / Create / Performance / 1.20.1 / NeoForge

## Extra performance:

[List of performance mods from TheUsefulLists](https://github.com/TheUsefulLists/UsefulMods/blob/main/Performance/Performance120.md#neoforge-120x)

(Only recommendation I would make different to this list is to use sodium instead of the recommended embeddium)

If you dont want to manually install the mods this is the recommended modpack: [Download Latest](https://modrinth.com/modpack/hammer/versions?c=release&c=beta&c=alpha&g=1.20.1&l=neoforge)

## If you want to use shaders:

If the shaderpack you use is on this list then you only need Iris, Create Better FPS and Colorwheel, if it isn't on this list then install Colorwheel Patcher alongside them:

    Euphoria Patches, since 1.7.0
    Eclipse (edit of Bliss, available on GitHub)
    Glimmer (available on GitHub)
    Shrimple (WIP, available on GitHub)
    
    Quoted from the colorwheel modrinth page

Some links are for forge. On 1.20.1 forge mods work on neoforge, this doesn't apply to 1.21 onwards.
